# Go Cache Library

This library provides a simple cache implementation in Go with TTL (time-to-live) for each key.

‚úèÔ∏è **This project was created for learning purposes**, but you are free to use this library in your own projects without any restrictions. Feel free to modify and distribute it under fair use terms.

## Features

- üßµ Thread-safe using `sync.RWMutex`.
- üóëÔ∏è Automatic eviction of the least recently used items when the capacity is reached.
- ‚è≥ Key-based TTL (time-to-live) handling.

## Installation

To use the library, you need to clone it to your local machine and install its dependencies.

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository to your machine:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LebovskiiS/in_memory_cache.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```sh
cd in_memory_cache
```

3. **Install all necessary dependencies:**

```sh
go mod tidy
```

This command will download all the required dependencies listed in the `go.mod` file.

## Usage

Here‚Äôs how you can use the library in your Go projects:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
	"github.com/LebovskiiS/in_memory_cache/lesson"
)

func main() {
	cache := lesson.NewCash()

	// Add items to the cache with a time-to-live (TTL)
	cache.Set("key1", "value1", 5*time.Second)

	// Retrieve items from the cache
	value, err := cache.Get("key1")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Key1:", value)
	}

	// Wait for the TTL to expire
	time.Sleep(6 * time.Second)

	// Try to retrieve the item again
	value, err = cache.Get("key1")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Key1:", value)
	}
}
```
